How did you know
I was hoping for a sign?
My heart was so
Close to closing time
Something 'bout you hit me like a

Freight train to the chest
Ah, the day we met
All my loneliness
Left the room the second that you

Walked in, something like a fever dream
Haven't slept in weeks, I think I'm seeing things
Like our shadows dancing us out of our clothes
I'll be damned if you love me
Damned if you don't

Maybe it's fate, maybe it's late
Told you I ain't no liar
Watching you leave's haunting my dreams
Baby, it hit me like a

Freight train to the chest
Ah, the day we met
All my loneliness
Left the room the second that you

Walked in, something like a fever dream
Haven't slept in weeks, I think I'm seeing things
Like our shadows dancing us out of our clothes
I'll be damned if you love me
Damned if you don't

One foot on the edge
Ah, that silhouette
Ah, I can't forget
Something 'bout you hit me like a
Freight train to the chest
Ah, the day we met
All my loneliness
Left the room the second that you

Walked in, something like a fever dream
Haven't slept in weeks, I think I'm seeing things
Like our shadows dancing us out of our clothes
I'll be damned if you love me
Damned if you don't

Oh, if you don't
